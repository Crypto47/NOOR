## How It Works

NOOR BOT is built using the GPT-3 Da Vinci model, which is trained on a diverse mental health dataset. It leverages the power of natural language processing and machine learning to generate responses based on the input it receives. The chatbot is designed to provide helpful and empathetic responses to a wide range of mental health queries.

The model has been fine-tuned on the mental health dataset to improve its understanding and response generation specifically for mental health-related conversations. It has been trained to handle a variety of topics, including anxiety, depression, stress management, self-care, and more.
